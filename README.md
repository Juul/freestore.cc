This is not even anything yet.

* Actually saving uploaded files
* Triggering transcode after completed upload
* Drag-drop multi-file upload
* Upload progress bar
* Client-side preliminary filetype detection
* Client-side thumbnail generation
* Server-side thumbnail generation
* Transcode progress reporting
